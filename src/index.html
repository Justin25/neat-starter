title: PhotonicStudent
photonicsDescription: Photonics is the science of light and its many practical applications. Photonics powers our cameras, screens, manufacturing, entertainment medicine, and much more. Nearly every aspect of our lives is in some way affected by photonics, and the uses for photonic technologies is ever expanding.
blogDescription: This blog primarily covers my experiences as an undergraduate student studying photonics. I write about general college life, engineering, photonics, and UCF. Also, I cover interesting developments in the fields of optics and photonics and how these technologies shape our lives.
